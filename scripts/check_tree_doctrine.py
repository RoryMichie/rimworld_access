"""Hand-rolled-tree ratchet for RimWorld Access.

A class that writes `ElementDescription.Expanded` is presenting a tree. Trees
must ride the shared machinery — a `TreeRegionScope`/`FilterTreeScopeBase`
subclass, or a composed `TreeModel` (via `TreeNavigationHelper`, `ITreeShape`,
`GeneTreeRegion`, `IdeoDetailsTreeRegion`) — so shell-wide tree behavior
(submenu mode, sibling jumps, expansion carry, typeahead auto-expansion)
applies everywhere at once. The scenario editor shipped a private row list with
its own expand flags and silently ignored the submenu setting; this ratchet
exists so that cannot recur.

Detection is class-level across partials: every file whose top-level class
matches is unioned before the tree-host markers are checked, since a partial
may declare the base class in a sibling file.

TREE_EXEMPT lists classes that legitimately present Expanded WITHOUT owning a
tree: they mirror expansion state that lives in a foreign object — a vanilla
window's own flags, a mod's own selected-row state, or another window's
captured rows — where forking the state into our own TreeModel would break
visual parity, plus describe-helpers feeding a shared-tree host the per-class
union cannot see. Each entry carries the owning object as its reason; a new
entry must name one.

TREE_BASELINE grandfathers true offenders (our-side expansion state outside
the shared tree) and is shrink-only: an entry that no longer matches is itself
a failure. It is EMPTY — keep it that way; migrate instead of adding.
