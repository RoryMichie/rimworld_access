"""Write-side mutation doctrine ratchet (the mutation doctrine in CLAUDE.md).

Game-state mutations must ride a vanilla vehicle: invoke the vanilla
widget/delegate itself (Category A), or a vanilla method that carries the
gate (Category B). Hand-copied gates (Category C) need a MUTATION-C marker;
raw ungated mutation (Category D) is forbidden. This script cannot judge
semantics, so it enforces the doctrine mechanically, four ways:

1. Reflection-write baseline: the per-file count of `.SetValue(` /
   `Traverse` sites (comment-stripped, MUTATION-C-marked lines exempt) is
   frozen. A new site fails the build until it is either rewritten onto a
   vanilla vehicle or justified with a MUTATION-C marker; a removed site
   fails too, demanding the baseline be tightened (that is the ratchet).
   Run with --emit-baseline to print the current counts.

2. Named forbidden mutations: signatures of known cheat-class calls
   (e.g. `Precept_Role.Assign` — vanilla only assigns roles through the
   RoleChange ritual flow) are forbidden outside their frozen allowlist.
   The allowlist shrinks to zero as the repairs land, then stays zero.

3. Cached-but-never-invoked gate handles: a file that caches a `CanAccept`
   MethodInfo must also invoke it. Calling a dialog's `Accept` without the
   `CanAccept` the vanilla button pairs it with is how the xenotype editor
   shipped an illegal-metabolism hole. Known offenders ride a PENDING list
   that must be emptied by the repairs; a fixed file left on the list fails.

4. Hand-picked text-field constraints: `maxLength: <numeric literal>` in a
   TextFieldSpec outside src/Input/TextInput/ is frozen per file. Field
   limits are harvested from the game (call-site args, dialog introspection,
   the game's own static fields), never chosen by hand.

5. Direct (non-reflection) game-state writes: an assignment straight into a
   live Verse/RimWorld object, with no `.SetValue`/`Traverse` indirection to
   trip check #1. This was the ratchet's blind spot -- the audit's worst
   escapes (quest accept, caravan gear) were exactly this shape. Python
   cannot resolve C# types, so detection is two curated, low-false-positive
   patterns rather than type inference:
     a. Any assignment reached through two-or-more dotted hops off a
        `Find.` singleton (`Find.GameInitData.startingTile = ...`). `Find.*`
        singletons are always live game managers, so this needs no
        per-member curation and has near-zero false positives.
     b. A hand-curated list of leaf field/property names (SENSITIVE_MEMBER_NAMES)
        harvested from known Verse/RimWorld types this codebase mutates
        directly through a local variable rather than a `Find.` chain
        (Faction's reward-preference bools, DrugPolicyEntry, AutoSlaughterConfig,
        Difficulty's Anomaly overrides, ...). Grow this list as new areas are
        swept for MUTATION-C coverage.
   A site is exempt if a MUTATION-C marker appears anywhere from its
   enclosing method's header down to the write itself (the doctrine allows
   the marker on "the mutating line or its enclosing member" -- a single
   marker routinely sits above a multi-case switch whose branches write ten
   or more lines below it). The unmarked-site baseline is exact (file +
   member name), not a count, so a rename or move surfaces as both a growth
   and a shrink. Run with --emit-baseline to print candidate baselines.

Usage: check_mutation_doctrine.py [--emit-baseline | --self-test]

--self-test plants a scratch file with two deliberately unmarked sensitive
writes, proves check #5 catches both, then deletes the scratch file.
