    ///    unhandled gizmo type still runs, it just announces by cleaned-up
    ///    type name, and this log is how we find out before a player does.

    /// 2. Runtime fallback counter: GetGizmoLabel reports every label that
    ///    falls back to the cleaned-up type name. Counts and offending types
    ///    are queryable via the dev bridge
    ///    (RimWorldAccess.InspectionSelfAudit.LabelFallbackCount / Report()).

    ///    enumerated from InspectTabBase, NOT ITab, so the WITab_* world tabs
    ///    are seen — must resolve through InspectNodeRegistry or be
