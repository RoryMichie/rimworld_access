    /// LIMITATIONS (read before trusting a negative result):
    /// - Covers exactly two stops, in real priority order: the shell dispatcher
    ///   (<see cref="ShellDispatcherPatch"/>, which includes the native modal swallow) and the
    ///   windowless-dialog handler.
    /// - Does NOT run the side-door UIRootOnGUI prefixes sitting between those two in the real chain
    ///   (WorkMenuPatch, AreaPatch), nor any other handler sharing the windowless-dialog handler's
    ///   priority tier (storage-settings, building-inspect) — a chord one of those owns misreports
    ///   here as "fell through".
    /// - Does NOT run KeyRemapPatch (layout remap / Cmd to Ctrl); moot, since a
    ///   <see cref="KeyChord"/> is already normalized and layout-independent.
    /// - Does NOT run vanilla window key handling (Window.OnCancelKeyPressed / OnAcceptKeyPressed and
    ///   the rest of the real window stack). A REAL blind spot, not a technicality: each open
    ///   window's deferred InnerWindowOnGUI re-tests the Accept/Cancel bindings on the raw event,
    ///   where the dispatcher's Use() is invisible (see WindowKeyRouter), so a real keypress can
    ///   close a window an injected one leaves open. Smoke tests must simulate that pass explicitly:
    ///   call Find.WindowStack.Notify_PressedAccept() / Notify_PressedCancel() right after injecting
    ///   Enter/Escape and assert the surface survived.
    /// - A handler that calls GUI/GUILayout APIs may throw when invoked outside a real OnGUI pass.
    ///   That exception is deliberately NOT caught: it propagates out of <see cref="Inject"/> and
    ///   surfaces in the bridge response.
