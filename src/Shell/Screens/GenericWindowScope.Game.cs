    /// signal (any raw capture row at all) the attach layer reads to decide between this scope and a
    /// shallower announce for a window that uses none of the captured vocabulary.
    ///
    /// <b>Own region, not the chassis's captured-extras region.</b> The extras region folds through
    /// <c>CapturedRowFolder</c> and DROPS rows carrying no interactive control, which would delete
    /// most of an unknown mod window (a plain Label here is navigable read-only context); it also
    /// addresses vanilla by DESCRIPTOR, which cannot name one thumb of a

    /// all driven here by capture INDEX. <see cref="IncludeCapturedExtrasRegion"/> therefore stays
    /// false and <see cref="ScreenScopeDrawPatch"/> never claims these windows.

    /// <b>Bracketing.</b> The patch brackets <see cref="WidgetCapture.BeginPass"/>/
    /// <see cref="WidgetCapture.EndPass"/> around the whole private, non-virtual
    /// <c>Window.InnerWindowOnGUI(int)</c>: <c>DoWindowContents</c> is abstract (no shared body to
    /// patch) and <c>WindowOnGUI</c> is overridable, while InnerWindowOnGUI is universal, is the
    /// sole caller of DoWindowContents, and wraps it in the window's own BeginGroup so captured
    /// rects are already window-local. Bracketing the whole call deliberately includes the window's
    /// close-X/close-button chrome, which a sighted player can click too.
    /// The patch resolves its instance by window identity via <see cref="byWindow"/>, never
    /// <c>FocusStack.Top</c> — several such scopes coexist (an unregistered dialog can open

    /// <b>Presentation model.</b> Navigation, injection and announcements read

    /// swatch to a RadioButton; a Listing_Tree node folds to one

    /// <c>SetOpen</c> runs; and a Range splits into TWO <see cref="ElementRole.Slider"/> rows over
    /// one capture index, one per vanilla thumb, adjusting through
    /// <see cref="WidgetCapture.RequestAdjustRange"/> with the core's "min - max" text consumed
    /// into their shared caption.
    /// Every injection call and the focus-ring argument to <see cref="WidgetCapture.BeginPass"/>
    /// must use a CAPTURE index — <see cref="PresentationRow.ActivateCaptureIndex"/> or
    /// <see cref="PresentationRow.RingCaptureIndex"/> — never the presentation index; only
    /// <see cref="ListModel"/>/typeahead/section logic operates on presentation indices.
    ///
    /// <b>Element model.</b> Non-heading <see cref="WidgetKind.Label"/> rows stay navigable and are
    /// announced read-only; a heading Label becomes no row at all and names the section every row
    /// below it IN ITS OWN COLUMN belongs to (see <see cref="SectionOwnership"/> — ownership is
    /// geometric, not draw order, so a heading never bleeds into a sibling column), spoken via
    /// <see cref="ApplySectionPrefix"/> and the PageUp/PageDown jumps. Window CHROME — anything
    /// drawn outside the group InnerWindowOnGUI wraps DoWindowContents in (see
    /// <see cref="ResolveWindowChromeRows"/>) — belongs to no section, names none, and never counts
    /// toward <see cref="HasMultipleSections"/>, while staying present and operable.
    ///
    /// <b>Own-label slider value rule.</b> Whether a value needs speaking turns on the slider's own
    /// captured <see cref="CapturedWidget.Label"/>, read before any caption fusion — never on
    /// RingCaptureIndex vs. ActivateCaptureIndex, which says nothing about whether a borrowed
    /// caption carries a number. A non-blank own label already holds the only value a sighted

    /// FormatSliderValue guess, keeping the AtMinimum/AtMaximum flags either way. The same test
    /// governs <see cref="RimWorldAccess.CapturedRowFolder"/>'s ITab slider path.
    ///
    /// <b>Activation.</b> Checkbox/RadioButton/Button post
    /// <see cref="WidgetCapture.RequestActivate"/>, so vanilla's own click handling and side
    /// effects run unmodified on the next pass; Slider posts
    /// <see cref="WidgetCapture.RequestAdjust"/> on Left/Right (Enter merely re-reads the row);

    /// CheckboxLabeledSelectable's second hotspot
    /// (<see cref="PresentationRow.SecondaryCaptureIndex"/>) — vanilla gives that control two

    /// <b>Tab-bar grammar.</b> A tab is a section of a screen: Tab/Shift+Tab switch tabs, the

    /// two or more (<see cref="HasTabBar"/>) and the switch rides the record's own
    /// <c>clickedAction</c> via <see cref="ActivateTabRow"/>, never a hand-set selection.
    /// <see cref="CycleTab"/> cycles from the tab vanilla draws as selected and speaks one
    /// utterance carrying the tab's position; only that path suppresses the deferred state-change
    /// channel, since Enter on a tab row keeps its own. Once <see cref="HasTabBar"/> is true, Tab
    /// rows leave <see cref="presentationRows"/> entirely (guarded so a window that is nothing but
    /// a strip does not go arrow-dead), so <see cref="CycleTab"/>/<see cref="HasTabBar"/> read the
    /// separate <see cref="tabRows"/> snapshot and the cursor lands on the first presentation row
    /// after a cycle.
    ///
    /// Checkbox/RadioButton/Slider/Tab state changes are announced DEFERRED: the tap records what a
    /// pass DRAWS, and the mod's own field assignment lands after that pass's capture, so an
    /// immediate announcement would speak the pre-request state.

    /// the unchanged state anyway — the honest "the mod clamped or rejected it" case.
    ///
    /// <b>Safety valve.</b> Every claim is gated on <see cref="HasInteractiveElements"/>: a
    /// <see cref="GracePasses"/>-pass benefit of the doubt (windows can draw nothing on frame 1),
    /// then permanent passivity if no non-Label presentation row was ever seen; once one is seen
    /// the gate stays open, so it never flaps. An orphan InvisibleButton and a LEAF tree row do not
    /// count; a fused pair, a marker-proven uncaptioned control, and an openable tree row do.
    ///
    /// <b>Escape/Accept posture.</b> <see cref="OwnsCancel"/> is STATE-BASED because
    /// <see cref="WindowCancelKeyRouterPatch"/> consults it from the WINDOW pass, which can run
