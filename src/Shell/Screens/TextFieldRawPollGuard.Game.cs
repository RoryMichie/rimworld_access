    /// Shared in-draw MASK for the browse/edit conversion of real vanilla text dialogs
    /// (Dialog_Rename, Dialog_GiveName, Dialog_NamePawn, Dialog_SaveFileList, …). Those
    /// dialogs poll <see cref="Event.current"/> for a Return/KeypadEnter KeyDown at the very
    /// top of their own <c>DoWindowContents</c> body and treat it as "submit" unconditionally —
    /// entirely bypassing <c>Window.OnAcceptKeyPressed</c>.
    ///
    /// R6 canon: the focused window's own GUI pass (this <c>DoWindowContents</c> call) can run
    /// BEFORE the shell dispatcher's main pass in the same frame, and it shares
    /// <see cref="Event.current"/> state with that pass — an <c>Event.current.Use()</c> here
    /// would make the triggering KeyDown arrive at the dispatcher already <c>Used</c>, starving
    /// whichever scope claim was supposed to act on it this same press (opening the edit
    /// session, or the session's own Enter-confirm/Escape-cancel claim). So this mechanism never
    /// calls <c>Use()</c>. Instead it stashes <c>Event.current.keyCode</c> and sets it to
    /// <see cref="KeyCode.None"/> for exactly the vanilla body that runs between
    /// <see cref="MaskAcceptPoll"/> and <see cref="RestoreAcceptPoll"/> — vanilla's raw poll
    /// (which tests <c>keyCode</c>) sees no Return/KeypadEnter, while every other window's pass
    /// and the dispatcher's main pass see the pristine KeyDown once it is restored (the same
    /// prefix-stash/postfix-restore shape as ModListPatch's arrow-key twin guard).
    ///
    /// Under the old always-live model those scopes deliberately LEFT Enter unclaimed so that
    /// raw poll was their submit path. Under browse/edit, Enter means something else on a field
    /// row — it opens the modal edit session (<see cref="TextFieldEditSession.EnterEdit"/>), and
    /// while editing Enter/Escape are the session's. This guard masks the raw poll on exactly
    /// those frames so vanilla cannot ALSO submit behind the session's back, while leaving a
    /// genuine browse-mode Enter on an OK/Accept button untouched (vanilla's poll submits as
    /// before).
    ///
    /// <b>Call shape.</b> <see cref="MaskAcceptPoll"/> is called from the owning scope's
    /// <c>DoWindowContents</c> PREFIX (before the vanilla body runs), passing state the CALLER
    /// already owns and can read at window-pass time — typically
    /// <c>TextInputManager.IsActive</c> (a modal session owns the keyboard) OR "the scope's
    /// cursor sits on a text-field row in browse mode" (Enter there is about to begin an edit).
    /// That caller-supplied bit is the load-bearing gate; it does not depend on anything the
    /// shell dispatcher's main pass sets, so it is correct whether the window pass runs before
    /// or after that main pass. <see cref="RestoreAcceptPoll"/> must be called from the matching
    /// POSTFIX every time <see cref="MaskAcceptPoll"/> was called, even when it masked nothing,
    /// so a masked keyCode never survives past the one call it was meant to hide from.
    ///
    /// <b>Nesting.</b> Two distinct patched <c>DoWindowContents</c> MethodInfos (e.g. closed
    /// generics <c>DialogTemplate&lt;ThingDef&gt;</c> and <c>DialogTemplate&lt;GeneDef&gt;</c>)
    /// can, under Mono, share one compiled method body when their generic arguments are both
    /// reference types. If two callers both detour that shared body, their prefix/postfix pairs
    /// NEST within one window pass: outer prefix, inner prefix, body, inner postfix, outer
    /// postfix. <see cref="maskDepth"/> makes that safe -- only the outermost
    /// <see cref="MaskAcceptPoll"/> call actually stashes/masks, and only the matching outermost
    /// <see cref="RestoreAcceptPoll"/> call actually restores, so an inner pair can never clobber
    /// the outer stash.
